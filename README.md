 Case Study 1: CYCLISTIC BIKE-SHARE
To process the data, I have chosen Python language as it is user-friendly and easily accessible. The first step is to import necessary libraries into the Jupyter notebook, such as Pandas for importing data from various file formats. It also allows data manipulation operations like merging, reshaping, selecting, data cleaning, and data wrangling features. Numpy is used for performing mathematical operations like trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic on arrays. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create graphical analysis of the data. Datetime is used to deal with dates, times, and time intervals.
